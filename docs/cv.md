## Software


* I'm the main developer of [AffectiveTweets](https://affectivetweets.cms.waikato.ac.nz/), a Weka package package for analysing emotion and sentiment of tweets.
* I've contributed to the NLP modules of the [WekaDeepLearning4j](https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) package.
* Some code for building sentiment lexicons from tweets is [here](http://cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/sa/lex.html) (the core of this code has been integrated into AffectiveTweets). 

## Shared Task Organistation

* Co-organiser of the SemEval-2018 Task 1: [Affect in Tweets](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17751).
* Co-organiser of WASSA-2017 [Emotion Intensity Detection](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/EmotionIntensity-SharedTask.html) Task.
